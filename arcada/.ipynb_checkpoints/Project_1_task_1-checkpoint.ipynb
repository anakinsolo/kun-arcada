Considering that current debiasing methods for general natural language understanding tasks cannot effectively mitigate the biases in the toxicity detectors, we propose to use invariant rationalization (InvRat), a game-theoretic framework consisting of a rationale generator and a predictor, to rule out the spurious correlation of certain syntactic patterns (e.g., identity mentions, dialect) to toxicity labels.

All our annotators are high school educated and frequent users of social media. Inter-rater agreement for the dataset as measured by Krippendorff{'}s Alpha is 0.67.

Unfortunately, the efficacy of community bans has only been partially studied and with mixed results. Here, we provide a flexible unsupervised methodology to identify in-group language and track user activity on Reddit both before and after the ban of a community (subreddit). We use a simple word frequency divergence to identify uncommon words overrepresented in a given community, not as a proxy for harmful speech but as a linguistic signature of the community. We apply our method to 15 banned subreddits, and find that community response is heterogeneous between subreddits and between users of a subreddit. Top users were more likely to become less active overall, while random users often reduced use of in-group language without decreasing activity. Finally, we find some evidence that the effectiveness of bans aligns with the content of a community. Users of dark humor communities were largely unaffected by bans while users of communities organized around white supremacy and fascism were the most affected.

Although previous approaches in Crisis NLP aggregate information across posts, they only use shallow representations of the content (e.g., keywords), which cannot adequately represent the semantics of a crisis event and its sub-events. In this work, we propose a novel framework to extract critical sub-events from a large-scale crisis event by combining important information across relevant tweets. Our framework first converts all the tweets from a crisis event into a temporally-ordered set of graphs. Then it extracts sub-graphs that represent semantic relationships connecting verbs and nouns in 3 to 6 node sub-graphs. It does this by learning edge weights via Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (DGCNs) and extracting smaller, relevant sub-graphs.

As the noisy text is a pervasive problem across languages, not just English, we leverage the multi-lingual pre-training of mBART to fine-tune it to our data. While current approaches mainly operate at the word or subword level, we argue that this approach is straightforward from a technical standpoint and builds upon existing pre-trained transformer networks. Our results show that while word-level, intrinsic, performance evaluation is behind other methods, our model improves performance on extrinsic, downstream tasks through normalization compared to models operating on raw, unprocessed, social media text.', 'pages': '473--482', 'doi': '10.18653/v1/2021.wnut-1.53', 'url': 'https://aclanthology.org/2021.wnut-1.53', 'publisher': 'Association for Computational Linguistics', 'address': 'Online', 'year': '2021', 'month': 'November', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the Seventh Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text (W-NUT 2021)', 'author': 'Bucur, Ana-Maria  and\\nCosma, Adrian  and\\nDinu, Liviu P.', 'title': 'Sequence-to-Sequence Lexical Normalization with Multilingual Transformers', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'inproceedings', 'ID': 'bucur-etal-2021-sequence'}, {'abstract': 'We present the winning entry to the Multilingual Lexical Normalization (MultiLexNorm) shared task at W-NUT 2021 (van der Goot et al., 2021a), which evaluates lexical-normalization systems on 12 social media datasets in 11 languages.

This task is beneficial for downstream analysis, as it provides a way to harmonize (often spontaneous) linguistic variation. Such variation is typical for social media on which information is shared in a multitude of ways, including diverse languages and code-switching. Since the seminal work of Han and Baldwin (2011) a decade ago, lexical normalization has attracted attention in English and multiple other languages. However, there exists a lack of a common benchmark for comparison of systems across languages with a homogeneous data and evaluation setup. The MultiLexNorm shared task sets out to fill this gap. We provide the largest publicly available multilingual lexical normalization benchmark including 13 language variants. We propose a homogenized evaluation setup with both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation. As extrinsic evaluation, we use dependency parsing and part-of-speech tagging with adapted evaluation metrics (a-LAS, a-UAS, and a-POS) to account for alignment discrepancies. The shared task hosted at W-NUT 2021 attracted 9 participants and 18 submissions. The results show that neural normalization systems outperform the previous state-of-the-art system by a large margin. Downstream parsing and part-of-speech tagging performance is positively affected but to varying degrees, with improvements of up to 1.72 a-LAS, 0.85 a-UAS, and 1.54 a-POS for the winning system.', 'pages': '493--509', 'doi': '10.18653/v1/2021.wnut-1.55', 'url': 'https://aclanthology.org/2021.wnut-1.55', 'publisher': 'Association for Computational Linguistics', 'address': 'Online', 'year': '2021', 'month': 'November', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the Seventh Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text (W-NUT 2021)', 'author': 'van der Goot, Rob  and\\nRamponi, Alan  and\\nZubiaga, Arkaitz  and\\nPlank, Barbara  and\\nMuller, Benjamin  and\\nSan Vicente Roncal, I{\\\\~n}aki  and\\nLjube{\\\\v{s}}i{\\\\\\'c}, Nikola  and\\n{\\\\c{C}}etino{\\\\u{g}}lu, {\\\\\"O}zlem  and\\nMahendra, Rahmad  and\\n{\\\\c{C}}olako{\\\\u{g}}lu, Talha  and\\nBaldwin, Timothy  and\\nCaselli, Tommaso  and\\nSidorenko, Wladimir', 'title': '{M}ulti{L}ex{N}orm: A Shared Task on Multilingual Lexical Normalization', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'inproceedings', 'ID': 'van-der-goot-etal-2021-multilexnorm'}, {'abstract': 'Social media is notoriously difficult to process for existing natural language processing tools, because of spelling errors, non-standard words, shortenings, non-standard capitalization and punctuation.

      "{``}在汉语等其他有省略代词习惯的语言中,通常会删掉可从上下文信息推断出的代词。尽管以Transformer为代表的的神经机器翻译模型取得了巨大的成功,但这种省略现象依旧对神经机器翻译模型造成了很大的挑战。本文在Transformer基础上提出了一个融合零指代识别的翻译模型,并引入篇章上下文来丰富指代信息。具体地,该模型采用联合学习的框架,在翻译模型基础上,联合了一个分类任务,即判别句子中省略代词在句子所表示的成分,使得模型能够融合零指代信息辅助翻译。通过在中英对话数据集上的实验,验证了本文提出方法的有效性,与基准模型相比,翻译性能提升了1.48个BLEU值。{''} \n",
